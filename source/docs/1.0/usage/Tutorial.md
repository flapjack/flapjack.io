# Flapjack Tutorial Attendee Preparation

If you're attending an upcoming Flapjack tutorial, please get the following things set up on your laptop beforehand if you wish to participate.

Please also come back to this page closer to the time of the tutorial to check if we've added any other optional preparation steps.

If you have any problems ping @auxesis or @jessereynolds on twitter, jump on to #flapjack on freenode (IRC), or post to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flapjack-project).

## 1. Get flapjack running locally

You will get the most out of the tutorial if you've got Flapjack running locally on your laptop beforehand. The simplest way to do this is to install flapjack as per the [Quickstart](http://flapjack.io/quickstart), which involves installing [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), cloning [vagrant-flapjack](https://github.com/flapjack/vagrant-flapjack) and running `vagrant up` within it.

You'll need Vagrant 1.5 or higher. A recent VirtualBox is recommended. `vagrant-flapjack` is currently tested with the following versions:

- Vagrant 1.6.3
- VirtualBox 4.3.14

There's a bit to download with that, so it's best to do this in your own time before the conference.

You don't need to have done the rest of the quickstart, though it can't hurt. The main thing is to have Flapjack running locally and to have Icinga or Nagios sending it check execution results. This is all taken care of by the `vagrant up` within [vagrant-flapjack](https://github.com/flapjack/vagrant-flapjack).

We are updating the vagrant-flapjack repo regularly so please ensure you go a `git pull` and `vagrant provision` in your vagrant-flapjack directory just before coming to the tutorial.

## 2. Get your IRC connected to #flapjack

You'll be able to get help from other participants during the tutorial (and afterwards) by asking in #flapjack on [freenode](https://freenode.net/).
