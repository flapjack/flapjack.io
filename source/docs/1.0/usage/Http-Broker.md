## Http Broker

Flapjack ships with an HTTP event broker that accepts events from external check execution systems over HTTP. The events are a json blob as defined in the Data Structure documentation with the addition of a 'ttl' attribute (time to live, in seconds).

The http broker can be used for non-heartbeat style event streams, where you send along a TTL and the broker will then cache the last state and repeatedly emit events for this check until the TTL expires, whereupon itâ€™ll start generating UNKNOWN events for that check.

The HTTP Broker is available as the `httpbroker` subcommand of the `receiver` subcommand eg `flapjack receiver httpbroker`.

Output of `flapjack receiver httpbroker --help`

```text
usage: httpbroker [<flags>]

Flags:
  --help               Show help.
  --port="3090"        Address to bind HTTP server (default 3090)
  --server="localhost:6380"
                       Redis server to connect to (default localhost:6380)
  --database=DATABASE  Redis database to connect to (default 0)
  --interval=10s       How often to submit events (default 10s)
  --debug              Enable verbose output (default false)
  --version            Show application version.
```

### Example

Start up the http broker on the default listen port of 3090 with debug verbosity:

```bash
flapjack1dev receiver httpbroker --debug
```


Submit an event:

```bash
curl -w 'response: %{http_code} \n' -X POST \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "entity": "foo-app-01",
    "check": "PING",
    "type": "service",
    "tags": "apps",
    "state": "OK",
    "summary": "3 ms round trip"
    "ttl": 30
  }' http://localhost:3090/state
```

You should get something like the following back from the curl command:

```text
Caching state: {"entity":"foo-app-01","check":"PING","type":"service",
"state":"OK","summary":"3 ms round trip","time":1429505587,"ttl":30}
response: 200
```

You should see some output from http broker like this:

```

2015/04/20 14:30:36 Sending event data for foo-app-01:PING
2015/04/20 14:30:46 Number of cached states: 1
2015/04/20 14:30:46 State for foo-app-01:PING is stale. Sending UNKNOWN.
2015/04/20 14:30:46 Sending event data for foo-app-01:PING
```

Notice how after the 30 second TTL expires the http broker starts sending UNKNOWN for this check.

### Limitations

* No state is persisted between restarts. http broker will start with a clean slate each time it starts up.
