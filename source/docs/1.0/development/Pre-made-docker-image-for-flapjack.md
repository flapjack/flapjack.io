Can get a pretty good out of box experience with docker and flapjack (running redis inside or outside)

I would propose setting up a hub.docker.com "org" for flapjack - adding a few owners - and then setting up an automated build/publish so people can trivially run flapjack via docker with confidence the image is the official one. 

Happy to "own" this - Michael.
