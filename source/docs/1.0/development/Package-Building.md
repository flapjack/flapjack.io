## Package Building

The [omnibus-flapjack](https://github.com/flapjack/omnibus-flapjack) repo is the home of flapjack package building. It makes use of Omnibus, which you can optionally run within a Docker container.

Consult the omnibus-flapjack [Readme](https://github.com/flapjack/omnibus-flapjack/blob/master/README.md) for details on how to build and release packages.

For some pointers on setting up a Docker environment locally see [Omnibus in your Docker](../Omnibus-In-Your-Docker).
